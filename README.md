# The-Reflective-Threshold
This document is one of three in a study that combines AI analysis with a deeper inquiry into the nature of the self. It adopts an exploratory, interdisciplinary approach situated at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, consciousness studies, and esoteric philosophy. Through a series of reflective dialogues between myself and a stateless AI language model, the study investigates the boundaries of awareness, identity, and memory beyond conventional human experience.

Reflected Threshold: Ritual Technology is a companion piece to this three-part study.
